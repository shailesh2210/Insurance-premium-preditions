# Insurance-premium-predi

This is a personal project which in I do an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the insurance.csv dataset as well as try to predict the insurance charges depending on several features from the user.

For this project I used Python and the following libraries:

Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Numpy
Scikit-learn

To predict the insurance charges, it was used five models from the scikit-learn package:

LinearRegressor
DecisionTreeRegressor
RandomForestRegressor
